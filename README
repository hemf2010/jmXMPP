This is a basic XMPP client for Android.  It supports roster updates,
incoming chats, and starting chats.  This was a small learning project
to work with XMPP and running background services on Android so the UI
is very basic with no frills, but gets the job done. It has only really
been used on Android 1.6 on my old G1, so your results may vary.

Feel free to clone it and build something nicer out of it.

This uses the Android port of the Smack library, so you will need to add
that to your project.
